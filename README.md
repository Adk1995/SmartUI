## Spatial Methodologic Approaches for Risk Assessment and Therapeutic Adaptation in Cancer Treatment (SMART-ACT)

Head and Neck Cancer although rare, affects a large number of people across the world. People of all races, ethnicities and background are equally prone to be diagnosed with head and neck cancer. The biggest challenge faced by oncologists is to not only specify personalised treatment options for patients but to also minimize the side effects that occur. Oncologists need to take into consideration a variety of factors such as radiomics data, survival rate, background as well as possibility of occuring side effects.
